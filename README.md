TIc Tac Toe on Java
X or O is randomly chosen to start each game
A board is initialized and a player places their move on the board each turn
Once 3 in a row, column, or diagonal is reached by either player, or the board is filled with no winner, the game ends
Once the game ends, score is added based on the game's outcome, and players are asked to play again
